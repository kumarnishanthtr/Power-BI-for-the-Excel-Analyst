Guided learning with the book

**Chapter 1 - Getting Started with Power BI**
Power BI allows user to create interactive reports. The end consumer can easily access and easily refresh the data whenever required.
It was launched in 2015.
Power BI consists of 2 elements:
  1. Power BI Desktop (place to build the reports)
  2. Power BI Service (place to share the reports)

**Chapter 2 - First Look â€“ an Introduction to Power BI Desktop**
When interacting with a report, to click links, always hold Control key and then click the link. Otherwise, the link will not work.
We can build highly customized reports which give us insights about the data. 
Four screens of Power BI Desktop
  1. Report view - place to add charts and other visual elements: Customer can see only this view
  2. Table view - underlying data consisting many tables
  3. Model view - place to link various tables and add relationships
  4. Power Query - place to clean-up / re-organize data into tables.
